# RxHaxe: Reactive Extensions for the Haxe
 

RxHaxe is a Haxe implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.
